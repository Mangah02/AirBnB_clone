            AirBnB clone - The console
            
            This is a project done in ALX School at Pair of two people

This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API,front-end integration

file description

0. create README, AUTHORS files
1. Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.
2. All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests
3. Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes
4. Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()). Now itâ€™s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.
5.  Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation
6. Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:
7. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands
8. Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel
9. Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel
10. Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review
11. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve all instances of a class by using: <class name>.all()
12. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve the number of instances of a class: <class name>.count()
13. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve an instance based on its ID: <class name>.show(<id>)
14. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to destroy an instance based on his ID: <class name>.destroy(<id>)
15. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: <class name>.update(<id>,<attribute name>, <attribute value>)
16. Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID with a dictionary
17. Write all unittests for console.py, all features!
